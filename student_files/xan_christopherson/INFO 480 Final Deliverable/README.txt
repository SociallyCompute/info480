The folder in which this document resides contains all the deliverables for the INFO 480-Intro to Data science Final Project

The Dataset is an MS Excel spreadsheet entitled Military Casualties Final Dataset.xlsx
The data contains records of all record military deaths from 2001-2012

The .twbx file contains the presented visuals of the data. To view this data, download the Tableau Reader Software and open the file within the program. 
	The software can be found at: http://www.tableausoftware.com/products/reader

A table of encoded values for country code is included as well. THis was used along with the text document called casualtyquery.txt to form the desired data set.

Some more alterations were completed in Excel to get the Date in the Date data type as well as the occupation code, using a LIKE state in SQL.
